# React Project: Code Challenge

[This is a React project](https://country-app-alibaba.netlify.app/) created as a part of a code challenge from [Alibaba-Vercel](https://alibaba-rest-countries.vercel.app/). In just 6 hours, I have developed a functional and responsive React application. This README file provides an overview of the project, its features, and instructions for running and deploying the application.

## Project Overview

The goal of this code challenge was to create a React application that showcases my coding skills and understanding of React concepts. The project demonstrates my ability to build interactive and dynamic user interfaces using React components, state management, and fetching data from external APIs.

## Features

The React project includes the following features:

1. **Data Fetching:** The application fetches data from an external API and displays it dynamically.
2. **Search Functionality:** Users can search for specific data or filter data based on specific criteria.
3. **Responsive Design:** The application is designed to be responsive, providing a seamless user experience across different devices and screen sizes.
4. **Error Handling:** Proper error handling is implemented to provide a smooth user experience and informative error messages.
5. **lazy loading**

## How to Run the Application

To run the application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```
   git clone [repository_url]
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd [project_directory]
   ```

3. Install the dependencies by running the following command:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the application by executing the following command:

   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

## Deployment

To deploy the application to a live environment, you can follow the deployment guidelines provided by Alibaba-Vercel or your preferred hosting platform. Ensure that you have configured the necessary environment variables and build scripts before deploying.
